# GuessTheNumber
This is a Kotlin app that I thought up and created myself!  It is a game in which you need to guess a random number between 1 and 100.  You first press the "Start New Game" to begin (at which point that button will disappear, and then you type numbers into the EditText and tap the "Submit" button to register your guess.  The "Attempts" TextView will update to show you how many attempts you have made.  Upon getting a guess incorrect, it will tell you if you need to guess higher or lower.  Also, if there is no guess or if the guess is out of bounds, it will let you know.  Once you guess the number correctly, it will tell you so, and if your number of attempts is lower than the previous "Fewest Attempts" number, then the "Fewest Attempts" TextView will update with the new, lower number.  The "Start New Game" button will also appear again after the previous game is finished.  You can try the game again and again to guess the correct answer in the fewest attempts possible.  When you completely close and re-open the app, the "Fewest Attempts" number will start at 100 again.
